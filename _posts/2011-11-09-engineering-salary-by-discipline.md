I created this chart to summarize the information I found on [engineersalary.com](http://engineersalary.com/).

![](/content/EngineerSalary.png)

The green bars on the left show relative number of jobs for each discipline. The bars in the chart show the salary ranges of the bottom 10%, middle 50%, and top 10%, respectively. The bars are cut off at $40k on the left and $150k on the right, so the bottom 10% and top 10% bars may extend beyond those bounds.

No data was given for average starting salary by degree level, for Aerospace Engineering.
