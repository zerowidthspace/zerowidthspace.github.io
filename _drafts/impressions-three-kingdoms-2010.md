The one outstanding feature of this series is the sense of chronological grandeur it evokes, something that I havenâ€™t seen in any Western cultural productions, ancient or modern. The main stories cover roughly one full generation of people, from the takeover of the Han court by Dong Zhou (189 AD) to the death of Sima Yi (251 AD). The series consists of 95 episodes at 40 minutes apiece. By the time deuteragonist Zhuge Liang is introduced in episode ??, remembering the story arcs of Dong Zhuo and Lyu Bu feels like ancient history -- and this is despite watching the show at breakneck pace (averaging roughly 3 episodes per day).

One thing I disliked was the melodramatics when used anachronistically. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is meant to be melodramatic in a lot of scenes: in funeral rites, before the Emperor, during a boast etc. Here the gestures and exaggerated dialogues fit in, as a tonal ??, as a deliberate manipulation by a character, or as cultural artifact. Scenes like the Jingshu miscarriage however are just unbearable to watch -- (compare to original novel? Study directors other works). They give the episodes a soap opera feel whereas I feel the narrative was already interesting enough and could stand on its own. There isn't much emotional nuance in the show either, but I can accept that as a deliberate stylistic choice. It doesn't take away from the series at all as the focus is on the intrigue.

I'm undecided on the musical score. There were very few pieces which repeated throughout the series, played as motifs. Three episodes in and you've basically heard all the themes that will ever be played: Grandeur, Suspense, Poignant, Contemplative, Surprise Faint.
